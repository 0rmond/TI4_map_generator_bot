Commands:
First you need to create map and set active map you modifying.
To create map use:
/create_map mapName
To set active map use:
/set_map mapName
/set_map_status mapName status
status: open or locked
Status open, means anyone can edit map, can join map as player;
Status locked means, only joined players and map creator can edit map. No more players can join
/join mapName <- join an open map to be able to edit even if map is locked
/leave mapName <- leave an open map
/show_map_info mapName <- information of map, status if open/locked and player list


For easy of setup suggest first command after map creation use
/add_tile setup 0
This adds a template with positions

Now additional commands:
/add_tile tileName positionOnMap
(We using somno template positions on map. from setup template and you see positions.
Also we support TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft and BottomRight positions coresponding to TL, TR, BL, BR
Mecatol position is MR)
/add_tile_list tileList <- tile list is code from map Generators like TTS uses, example: https://ti4-map-generator.derekpeterson.ca/
You can use also tileID, so liek TI4 marks tiles 01 is Jord for example
/list_tiles <- lists all tiles, use starting number id to add to map
/remove_tile tileName or position
/list_maps <- lists all available maps that are created
/list_planets <- lists all available planets
/delete_map <-deletes your map, only can delete the map you created
/show_map mapName <- displays the map
/list_units <- lists all possible units
/add_cc colorList tile or position <- add's cc to system: colorList can be pink,red,black as example/
/remove_cc color tile or position <- remove's cc from system: ccolorList can be pink,red,black as example/
/remove_all_cc confirmation(YES) <- need to type in YES, will remove all CC's from active map
/add_control color tile planetList <- need to specify tile and planetList, example /add_control pink 3a arnor,lor
/remove_control color tile planet
and most interesting is
/add_units color tile unitList
/remove_units color tile unitList
/remove_all_units color tile

unitList examples and explanation. If dont specify planet, all units go into space
Listing only unit list, so add into command that you want
dn <- sinle dread into space
dread <- same sinle dread into space
3 dn <- 3 dreads added into space
3 dn, 2 destroyers <- 3dread and 2 dd added into space
3 dn, 2 dd, gf quann <- 3 dread and 2dd added into space, 1 gf added onto planet quann
ws, 6 ff, sd quann, 3 inf quann, mech quann <- warsun and 6 fighters added into space, spacedock, 3 infantry and mech added into quann

/move_units color systemFrom unitList systemTo unitList addCC
Standard fields to add tile/system, unit list same as add, remove, and we have optional field addCC, type anything in to not add cc into moved system
Example:
/move_units pink quann 2 dn, dd, gf, gf quann wellon 2 dn, dd, 2 gf wellon
