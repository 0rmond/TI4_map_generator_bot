First you need to create map and set active map you modifying.
To create map use:
/create_map mapName
To set active map use:
/set_map mapName

For easy of setup suggest first command after map creation use
/add_tile setup 0
This adds a template with positions

Now additional commands:
/add_tile tileName positionOnMap
(We using somno template positions on map. from setup template and you see positions.
Also we support TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft and BottomRight positions coresponding to TL, TR, BL, BR
Mecatol position is MR)
/add_tile_list tileList <- tile list is code from map Generators like TTS uses, example: https://ti4-map-generator.derekpeterson.ca/
You can use also tileID, so liek TI4 marks tiles 01 is Jord for example
/list_tiles <- lists all tiles, use starting number id to add to map
/remove_tile tileName or position
/list_maps <- lists all available maps that are created
/delete_map <-deletes your map, only can delete the map you created

/remove_all_cc tile or position
/add_control color tile planet <- need to specify tile and planet, we working to improve it
/remove_control color tile planet
and most interesting is
/add_units color tile unitList
/remove_units color tile unitList
